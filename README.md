INTRODUCTION
This is the first README file I have ever written :)

I wanted to combine what I've learned on various online courses (mostly Codecademy) and the Code First Girls Introduction to Web Development Course.
I had made similar projects using alert boxes and was determined to work out how to query the DOM to graduate from the pesky alert boxes.
The code works.
Is it elegant? Maybe not.
Could I refactor it? Probably.
It works though and I am happy with that for now. After all, all great works of art aren't so much completed as abandoned.
Greater elegance is an important ambition for future projects.

The main emphasis here was very much on getting the JavaScript to enable user interactivity. 
SUCCESS!!
ALthough aesthetic consierations were secondary, the site has been designed for mobile first, with some (media query) adjustments for larger screen sizes.

TECHNOLOGIES
I wrote this using Visual Code,
HTML5,
CSS3,
JavaScript - ECMAScript 2018.

LAUNCH
This should run in most browsers and especially in Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 9.
